No conflict.  \n\nBut is there a contradiction in \"temperate\"?  \nFrom: Rompuses are zumpuses. Zumpuses are impuses. No direct negation.  \n\nBut check: \"Each rompus is temperate\" and \"Rex is a rompus\" → temperate.  \nHowever, \"Every zumpus is dull\" — no problem, dull doesn’t contradict temperate logically.  \n\nBut wait — \"Jompuses are not temperate\" — maybe Rex is also a jompus?  \nWe have: Rex is yumpus → numpus → vumpus → dumpus → rompus → temperate.  \nNo path to jompus. So Rex is temperate.  \n\nBut maybe \"zumpuses are impuses\" and \"impuses\" link to \"jompuses\"? No given link.  \n\nBut maybe earlier: \"Tumpuses are yumpuses\" — so Rex is a tumpus.  \nTumpuses are luminous — irrelevant.  \n\nBut maybe: \"Rompuses are zumpuses\" and \"Zumpuses are impuses\" and \"Jompuses are not temperate\" — if impuses are jompuses? Not stated.  \n\nBut maybe: \"Each dumpus is floral\" and \"Dumpuses are rompuses\" — so dumpus = rompus.  \nSo Rex is rompus → temperate.  \n\nBut check: \"Every zumpus is dull\" — rompuses are zumpuses, so rompus is zumpus → dull.  \nBut \"dull\" could be opposite of \"luminous\"? No, luminous was tumpuses.  \n\nActually, possible hidden contradiction: \"Tumpuses are luminous\" and \"Every tumpus is a yumpus\" and \"Every yumpus is large\" etc. But nothing contradicts temperate except if zumpus implies not temperate.  \n\nBut \"zumpus is dull\" — \"dull\" might mean not sharp, not necessarily not temperate.  \n\nBut maybe in logic puzzle, \"dull\" = \"not bright\" = \"not sharp\" = metaphor for \"not temperate\"? Unlikely; they'd state it.  \n\nGiven the chain: Rex → yumpus → numpus → vumpus → dumpus → rompus → temperate.  \nSo Rex is temperate.  \n\nBut wait — \"Jompuses are not temperate\" — maybe jompus is same as zumpus?  \n\"Zumpuses are impuses\" — if impuses are jompuses, then zumpuses are jompuses → not temperate.  \nBut rompuses are zumpuses → rompuses are jompuses → rompuses are not temperate.  \nBut earlier: \"Each rompus is temperate.\"  \n\nThat’s a direct contradiction:  \n• Each rompus is temperate.  \n\n• Rompuses are zumpuses.  \n\n• Zumpuses are impuses.  \n\n• If impuses are jompuses, then rompuses are jompuses.  \n\n• Jompuses are not temperate.  \n\nSo rompus is temperate and not temperate — impossible.  \nThus, the only consistent reading: \"impuses\" are not necessarily \"jompuses\" unless stated.  \nSince no \"impuses are jompuses\" given, no contradiction.  \n\nSo Rex is temperate.  \n\nBut careful — maybe \"zumpuses are impuses\" and \"jompuses are not temperate\" — if impuses = jompuses, contradiction. But not stated, so ignore.  \n\nThus, Rex is temperate.  \n\nBut — maybe the puzzle intends: \"Rompuses are zumpuses. Every zumpus is dull. Zumpuses are impuses. Jompuses are not temperate.\"  \nIf \"impuses\" = \"jompuses\" is implied by naming? No, not safe to assume.  \n\nGiven normal logic, Rex is temperate.  \n\nBut if they want a trick: \"Each rompus is temperate\" and \"Rompuses are zumpuses\" — maybe \"are\" means \"some\" not \"all\"? Usually in these puzzles, \"X are Y\" means all X are Y.  \n\nBut \"Each rompus is temperate\" is universal. \"Rompuses are zumpuses\" likely means all rompuses are zumpuses. Then all rompuses are temperate and all rompuses are zumpuses. If all zumpuses are impuses, and if impuses are jompuses, contradiction. But since \"impuses are jompuses\" not stated, no contradiction.  \n\nSo answer: True.  \n\nBut wait — look at last part: \"Zumpuses are impuses. Jompuses are not temperate.\" Could be irrelevant.  \n\nBut maybe \"jompuses\" is from \"dumpus\"? No.  \n\nGiven chain, Rex is temperate.  \n\nSo:  \n\nThe correct option is: A"
