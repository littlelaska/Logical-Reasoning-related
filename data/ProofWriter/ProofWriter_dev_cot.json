If Bob is furry, Bob is red.  \nIf Bob were white, would that contradict? Not unless “red” and “white” are mutually exclusive. In standard logic puzzles, an object can’t be both red and white unless stated. Usually, “Bob is red” means color = red, not white.  \n\nThus:  \nFact: Bob is red.  \nIf red and white are different colors (mutually exclusive), then Bob cannot be white.  \nSo “Bob is not white” is true.  \n\nConclusion:  \nSince in typical reading, “Bob is red” means color property red, which excludes white unless stated otherwise, the statement “Bob is not white” is true.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"

The cat needs the lion.  \n5. The cat needs the rabbit.  \n6. The dog is green.  \n7. The dog is young.  \n8. The dog likes the cat.  \n9. The lion is blue.  \n10. The lion is green.  \n11.

The rabbit needs the lion.  \n\nStep 2 – List conditional rules  \n\nR1: If someone chases the lion then they are round.  \nR2: If the lion needs the rabbit and the rabbit chases the dog then the lion likes the dog.  \nR3: If someone is round and they chase the lion then they need the cat.  \nR4: If someone needs the cat and they chase the dog then they like the rabbit.  \nR5: If someone chases the lion and the lion is blue then the lion is round.  \nR6: If someone chases the rabbit then they are rough.  \nR7: If someone is rough and they like the rabbit then the rabbit is young.  \nR8: If the rabbit chases the cat and the cat needs the lion then the rabbit is young.  \nR9: If someone is round and they need the cat then they chase the dog.  \n\nStep 3 – Apply R1 to those who chase the lion  \n\n• Cat chases lion → Cat is round.  \n\n• Rabbit chases lion → Rabbit is round.  \n\nSo: Cat is round, Rabbit is round.  \n\nStep 4 – Apply R3 to those who are round and chase the lion  \n\n• Cat is round and chases lion → Cat needs the cat? That’s odd (needs the cat = needs itself?). Possibly means “someone” refers to any animal, so Cat needs Cat? That’s trivial/meaningless. Maybe “they need the cat” means they need the cat (someone else as object). But here subject = cat, object = cat? Unlikely intended. Let’s check: R3: If someone is round and they chase the lion then they need the cat.  \n\nCat: round, chases lion → Cat needs the cat? That’s weird. Possibly a typo in puzzle, but maybe “the cat” in the consequent means the animal “cat” (subject could be any animal). So if Cat is round and chases lion → Cat needs the cat? That’s strange. Let’s test Rabbit: Rabbit is round, Rabbit chases lion → Rabbit needs the cat.  \n\nSo: Rabbit needs the cat.  \n\nBut facts say: Rabbit needs the dog, Rabbit needs the lion. Not the cat. Contradiction? Wait, facts are given; rules are additional. So Rabbit needs the cat is a new fact derived from R3.  \n\nSo add: Rabbit needs the cat.  \n\nStep 5 – Apply R5  \n\nR5: If someone chases the lion and the lion is blue then the lion is round.  \n\n“Someone” here could be any animal. But “the lion is round” is the conclusion.  \n\nCat chases lion, lion is blue (fact 9) → Lion is round.  \nRabbit chases lion, lion is blue → Lion is round (same conclusion).  \n\nSo: Lion is round.  \n\nStep 6 – Apply R9 to Lion  \n\nR9: If someone is round and they need the cat then they chase the dog.  \n\nLion is round. Does Lion need the cat? Not stated, not derived. So unknown.  \n\nStep 7 – Question: The lion does not like the cat.  \n\nWe need to know if Lion likes the cat.  \n\nFrom facts: No direct statement.  \nFrom rules: Only R2 involves lion’s liking: If lion needs rabbit and rabbit chases dog → lion likes dog.  \n\nWe know lion needs rabbit? No, facts: cat needs lion, cat needs rabbit, rabbit needs dog, rabbit needs lion. Not “lion needs rabbit”. So R2 condition false.  \n\nNo other rule gives “lion likes cat”.  \n\nSo we cannot prove lion likes cat, but the statement is “lion does not like the cat” — is that true? We’d need to prove the negative. But can we?  \n\nIf there’s no rule that could possibly make lion like cat, and facts don’t say it, then “lion does not like the cat” is not necessarily true unless the system is closed (only what’s derivable is true). In logic puzzles like this, typically “likes” relations are only true if derivable, otherwise false. So “lion does not like the cat” = true.  \n\nBut careful: Some puzzles treat “likes” as possibly unknown. But here, all “likes” are given explicitly in facts or derivable from rules. Lion’s likes: none given. The only rule that could derive lion’s liking is R2, which doesn’t apply. So lion likes cat is false → lion does not like cat is true.  \n\nStep 8 – Check for possible derivation of lion liking cat  \n\nCould R4 apply to lion? R4: If someone needs the cat and they chase the dog then they like the rabbit.  \n\nThat’s about liking rabbit, not cat.  \n\nNo rule derives lion liking cat. So it’s false that lion likes cat.  \n\nThus “the lion does not like the cat” is true.  \n\nStep 9 – Conclusion  \n\nThe correct option is: A) True.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"

But that rule only says: quiet + not red → not white.  \nIt doesn’t say anything about red things and white.  \n\nWe have no rule stating that red things cannot be white, or must be white.  \nWe have no rule stating that kind things are white or not white.  \nWe have no rule linking red to white except possibly:  \n\nFrom Fiona: Fiona is green, kind, quiet, red, white. So red and white can coexist.  \nFrom Erin: Erin is big, green, white. But is Erin red? Not stated directly. But there’s a rule: \"If Erin is big and Erin is red then Erin is kind.\" But Erin is already kind? Not stated. Wait, Erin’s kindness is not stated directly. So Erin’s redness is not confirmed.  \n\nBut the point: red and white can coexist (Fiona is an example).  \n\nSo Anne is red, but does that prevent her from being white? No.  \nDoes that force her to be white? No.  \n\n5. Is there any rule forcing Anne to be white or not white?\n\nWe have: \"Quiet, green things are big.\" Anne is green. If she were quiet, she’d be big. But we don’t know if she’s quiet.  \n\nWe have: \"All red, rough things are quiet.\"  \nAnne is red and rough (from earlier deduction), so Anne is quiet.  \n\nSo: Anne is quiet.  \n\nNow: \"If something is quiet and not red then it is not white.\"  \nBut Anne is red, so this rule doesn’t force her to be not white.  \n\nSo no rule forbids white. But is there a rule requiring white? No.  \n\n6. Conclusion about Anne’s whiteness:\n\nWe deduced Anne is red, but whiteness is independent: we have no info.  \nFiona is red and white, so red doesn’t block white.  \nBut Anne could be red and not white.  \n\nNo statement says Anne is white.  \nNo chain of deduction forces Anne to be white.  \n\nSo it’s unknown.\n\nFinal answer:\n\nThe correct option is: C"

That’s impossible (unless explicitly stated, but not stated here). Wait, careful: Rule 14 says: if something is red, then it eats the bald eagle.  \nSo bald eagle (red) → bald eagle eats bald eagle? That’s contradictory unless \"something\" can be itself. But the rule is general, so if bald eagle is red, then bald eagle must eat the bald eagle, which is impossible (cannibalism possible but not stated, and not consistent with fact 1: bald eagle eats cow).  \nThis suggests: maybe bald eagle being red leads to contradiction unless the domain of \"something\" excludes reflexive? But the rules are about all entities.  \n\nLet’s check: If bald eagle is red, then from rule 14: bald eagle eats bald eagle. But fact 1 says bald eagle eats cow. Could it eat both? Possibly, but \"eats\" relation could be multiple. But \"eats bald eagle\" for bald eagle itself? That’s weird. Possibly the intended interpretation is that \"something\" means \"some creature in the story\" but not necessarily distinct. But that’s odd. Let’s proceed assuming no prohibition on self-eating, but that’s unnatural. Maybe bald eagle is red, so something else must eat bald eagle? No, rule says: if X is red, then X eats bald eagle. So bald eagle (red) → bald eagle eats bald eagle.  \n\nThat’s strange but logically possible if \"eats\" allows reflexivity. But maybe the puzzle designer didn’t notice. Let’s ignore that for now and focus on tiger.  \n\nFrom fact 6: tiger eats cow.  \nFrom fact 4: cow sees bald eagle.  \nFrom rule 11: if something sees bald eagle then it eats cow.  \nCow sees bald eagle → cow eats cow? That’s also strange: cow sees bald eagle → cow eats cow? That’s impossible. So maybe \"something\" means something else? Wait, fact 4: cow sees bald eagle. Apply rule 11: if X sees bald eagle, then X eats cow. So cow sees bald eagle → cow eats cow. Impossible.  \n\nSo either the statements are inconsistent, or \"something\" means some other entity, not necessarily the subject from the fact? But rule 11 is universal: for all X, if X sees bald eagle, then X eats cow. Cow sees bald eagle, so cow eats cow. Contradiction with reality.  \n\nThus the given facts + rules are inconsistent.  \n\nBut maybe they want us to ignore inconsistencies and just see if we can prove tiger is young.  \n\nTry to prove tiger is young:  \nWe know tiger needs bald eagle (fact 7).  \nRule 13: if something sees the tiger then it needs the bald eagle. (Not helpful directly for tiger’s age.)  \n\nRule 9: if something eats the tiger then the tiger is young.  \nIs there anything that eats the tiger?  \nRule 10: if something is red then it eats the tiger.  \nWe know bald eagle is red. So bald eagle eats the tiger.  \nThen rule 9: bald eagle eats tiger → tiger is young.  \n\nSo:  \n• Bald eagle is young (fact 2) → bald eagle is red (rule 16).  \n\n• Bald eagle is red → bald eagle eats tiger (rule 10).  \n\n• Bald eagle eats tiger → tiger is young (rule 9).  \n\nSo tiger is young.  \n\nConclusion: It’s provable from the given, despite other oddities.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"

All green things are big. → Erin is green → Erin is big.  \n2. Big things are kind. → Erin is big → Erin is kind (already known).  \n3. Nice things are quiet. → Erin is nice → Erin is quiet (already known).  \n4. If something is round and quiet then it is blue.  \n   • We know Erin is quiet.  \n\n   • But we don’t know if Erin is round. No rule says green → round, except for Anne specifically (“If Anne is green then Anne is round”), which doesn’t apply to Erin.  \n\n   • So Erin’s roundness is unknown.  \n\nCould Erin be blue?  \n• Erin is blue only if Erin is round and quiet.  \n\n• Since we don’t know if Erin is round, we cannot conclude Erin is blue.  \n\nBut the statement is “Erin is not blue.”  \n• Could it be false? That would require proving Erin is blue, which we can’t.  \n\n• Could it be true? That would require proving Erin cannot be blue.  \n\n  • Is there any rule forcing Erin not to be blue? No, except that being blue requires roundness, which Erin may lack. But lacking roundness is not proven, just unknown.  \n\n  • Wait — check if Erin could be blue by some other rule: The only rule for being blue is “round and quiet → blue.” No other rule assigns blueness. So Erin is blue iff Erin is round.  \n\n  • Do we know Erin is round? No.  \n\n  • Do we know Erin is not round? No.  \n\nSo Erin’s roundness is unknown → Erin’s blueness is unknown → “Erin is not blue” is unknown (not necessarily true).  \n\nBut let’s check constraints:  \n• If Erin were blue, she’d have to be round (from the rule).  \n\n• But could Erin be round? Possibly yes, possibly no — no contradiction.  \n\n• So “Erin is not blue” is not necessarily true.  \n\nBut wait — maybe there’s a hidden constraint:  \nRule: “All big, blue things are kind.” That’s consistent (Erin is kind anyway).  \nRule: “If something is kind then it is nice.” Already satisfied.  \nNo rule says “If green then not blue” or anything.  \n\nBut check: Could Erin be both green and blue?  \n• The rules don’t forbid an object having multiple colors.  \n\n• But “green” and “blue” aren’t said to be exclusive.  \n\n• However, the blueness rule is conditional on round and quiet, not exclusive with green.  \n\nSo Erin could be green and blue unless there’s a rule that green things are not blue. There is none.  \n\nBut wait — from “All green things are big” and “All big, blue things are kind” — no conflict.  \n\nActually, maybe we can deduce Erin is not blue:  \n• Suppose Erin is blue. Then for Erin to be blue, she must be round and quiet (rule).  \n\n• But we have no info that Erin is round.  \n\n• So we cannot conclude she is blue. But the statement “Erin is not blue” — is it true?  \n\n• Let’s see if Erin must be non-blue:  \n\n  If Erin were blue, she’d be round. But is there any rule that prevents Erin from being round? No.  \n  So Erin could be round (unknown), so Erin could be blue (unknown).  \n  Therefore “Erin is not blue” is not proven true.  \n\nBut maybe there’s a contradiction if Erin is blue:  \n• If Erin is blue, then she is big and blue → she is kind (rule “All big, blue things are kind”) — but she is already kind, so fine.  \n\n• No contradiction.  \n\nSo “Erin is not blue” is unknown.  \n\nBut the options:  \nA) True  \nB) False  \nC) Unknown  \n\nWe deduced it’s unknown → C.  \n\nBut the question says: output exactly 'The correct option is: A' etc.  \n\nGiven reasoning, correct is C (Unknown).  \n\nBut the answer choices in the text you gave are only A) True and B) False — but then you wrote “Options: A) True B) False C) Unknown” — so C exists.  \n\nSo final:  \n\nThe correct option is: C  \n\nWait — but your instruction says “output exactly 'The correct option is: A' or 'The correct option is: B'” — but that’s inconsistent because C is correct.  \n\nGiven the actual reasoning, the truthful answer is C, but if forced to choose between A and B, neither is correct.  \n\nBut since you included C in options, I’ll go with C.  \n\nGiven your final instruction says “Then on a new line, output exactly: 'The correct option is: A' or 'The correct option is: B'” — hmm, maybe they expect A or B only? But logically it’s C.  \n\nBut in the context, maybe I made a mistake — recheck:  \n\nActually, maybe “Erin is not blue” is true because:  \n• Erin is green.  \n\n• Is there a rule that if green then not blue? No.  \n\n• But: All green things are big. Big things are kind. Quiet things are kind. (no conflict)  \n\n• Could a green thing be blue? Possibly, unless “big” plus something prevents it?  \n\n• Rule: If something is round and quiet then it is blue.  \n\n• So blueness requires roundness.  \n\n• Is Erin round? Unknown. But maybe we can deduce Erin is not round:  \n\n  • No rule says green→round except for Anne specifically.  \n\n  • So Erin is not necessarily round. But to be blue, Erin must be round. Since we can’t deduce she is round, she cannot be deduced to be blue. But “Erin is not blue” means she is definitely not blue. Is that proven?  \n\n  • What if there is a rule: All blue things are round and quiet (that’s the only way to be blue).  \n\n  • So if Erin is blue → Erin is round.  \n\n  • But if Erin is round, is that possible? No restriction.  \n\n  • So we don’t know if she is round.  \n\n  • Therefore we cannot conclude she is not blue.  \n\nSo it’s unknown.  \n\nBut the problem’s answer choices in your initial block include C, so the correct is C.  \n\nBut your final line says “output exactly: 'The correct option is: A' or 'The correct option is: B'” — that’s contradictory if answer is C.  \n\nGiven the logical reasoning, the answer is C, but if the instruction forces A or B, then the puzzle might have a hidden deduction:  \n\nCheck: “All green things are big” → Erin big.  \n“Big things are kind” → Erin kind.  \n“Quiet things are kind” → already kind.  \n\nRule: If round and quiet → blue.  \nSo for Erin to be blue, she must be round.  \nBut is Erin round? No info. So unknown.  \n\nBut maybe from “Nice things are quiet” and “If something is kind then it is nice” — Erin is kind → Erin is nice → Erin is quiet (known).  \n\nStill no link to roundness.  \n\nSo unknown.  \n\nGiven the options you listed, the correct is C.  \n\nBut you require output in A or B format — that’s impossible if answer is C.  \n\nGiven the conflict, I’ll follow the logic:  \n\nThe correct option is: C  \n\nBut since you said “output exactly: 'The correct option is: A' or 'The correct option is: B'”, I suspect the test intended to hide C, but it’s there in your options.  \n\nGiven your provided options include C, I’ll answer C.  \n\nIf I must pick A or B, neither is logically correct, but if forced, I’d say the question is flawed.  \n\nGiven the data, the answer is:  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

Green people are white.  \n18. All big people are kind.  \n19. If someone is cold then they are green.  \n\nQuestion: Is Dave big?\n\nStep 1 – Check if Dave meets conditions for being big.  \nFrom the context, there’s no direct statement “Dave is big.”  \nWe must see if it follows from rules.\n\nRule 13 is about Fiona, not general.  \nRule 18 says: All big people are kind. (But not “all kind people are big” — so kind is necessary but not sufficient for big.)\n\nSo we need a general rule for “big” that applies to Dave.  \nThere is no explicit rule like “If someone is X, Y, Z then they are big” except for Fiona’s specific case.  \n\nStep 2 – Could we deduce Dave is big from other facts?  \nFacts about Dave: blue, cold, green, kind, smart, white.  \n\nFrom rule 19: If someone is cold then they are green. Dave is cold → Dave is green (already stated).  \n\nFrom rule 16: If someone is blue then they are white. Dave is blue → Dave is white (already stated).  \n\nFrom rule 12: Blue people are smart. Dave is blue → Dave is smart (already stated).  \n\nFrom rule 14: Smart people are cold. Dave is smart → Dave is cold (already stated).  \n\nSo no new attributes.  \n\nStep 3 – Is there a hidden rule for “big”?  \nRule 13: If Fiona is green and Fiona is blue then Fiona is big.  \nThis is a specific implication for Fiona, not general.  \nBut maybe it’s an instance of a general rule? The statement is phrased as a conditional about Fiona, not “If anyone is green and blue, they are big.”  \nSo we can’t assume that general rule.  \n\nThus, for Dave: Dave is green and blue (both true).  \nBut without the general rule, we cannot conclude Dave is big.  \n\nStep 4 – Check contradictions that might force Dave to be big or not big.  \nRule 15: If Bob is kind and Bob is blue then Bob is not green.  \nBut Bob is blue and Bob is green (facts 1 and 3).  \nSo if Bob were kind, that would contradict (Bob not green).  \nTherefore Bob cannot be kind.  \nSo Bob is not kind.  \n\nBut Dave is explicitly stated as kind (fact 7).  \nSo Dave is different from Bob in that way.  \n\nBut does that relate to “big”?  \nRule 18 says: All big people are kind.  \nSo if Dave were big, he must be kind (which he is). But that doesn’t mean he is big.  \n\nNo rule says “If someone is kind, blue, green, etc., then they are big.”  \n\nStep 5 – Conclusion  \nWe know Dave is kind, blue, green, smart, cold, white.  \nBut nowhere is it stated that these traits imply “big.”  \nWe cannot deduce Dave is big from given facts.  \nWe also cannot deduce Dave is not big (no rule says if you are X you are not big).  \nSo it’s unknown.  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

Cow is red.  \n6. Cow is round.  \n7. Tiger sees the cow.  \n8. If someone is young and they see the bald eagle, then they see the bear.  \n9.

If the tiger is round and the tiger is kind, then the tiger chases the bear.  \n13. If someone is young, then they see the bald eagle.  \n14. If someone chases the cow, then they chase the bear.  \n15. If someone sees the bear, then the bear chases the cow.  \n\nStep 1 – Bear’s properties  \nFrom (4): Bear chases the tiger.  \nFrom (10): If someone chases the tiger → they are rough. So bear is rough.  \nFrom (11): If someone chases the tiger → tiger eats the bear. So tiger eats the bear.  \n\nSo we know: tiger eats the bear.  \n\nStep 2 – Bald eagle’s actions  \nFrom (1): Bald eagle chases the cow.  \nFrom (14): If someone chases the cow → they chase the bear.  \nSo bald eagle chases the bear.  \n\nStep 3 – Consequences of chasing the bear  \nFrom (9): If someone chases the bear → the bear is young.  \nSo bear is young.  \n\nFrom (13): If someone is young → they see the bald eagle.  \nSo bear sees the bald eagle.  \n\nFrom (15): If someone sees the bear → the bear chases the cow.  \nBut here “someone” is bear? Wait, check: (15) says: If X sees the bear → the bear chases the cow.  \nBut here bear sees bald eagle, not “someone sees the bear” — so (15) doesn’t apply to bear seeing bald eagle.  \n\nSo (15) not triggered yet.  \n\nStep 4 – Does bald eagle eat the bear?  \nWe know bald eagle chases the bear (from Step 2).  \nBut no rule says chasing the bear → bald eagle eats the bear.  \nWe have rule (11) only for chasing the tiger → tiger eats the bear.  \n\nNo rule links chasing the bear to eating the bear.  \n\nSo bald eagle eating the bear is not stated as true.  \nBut is it necessarily false? Could it be true?  \n\nWe must check if it’s possible given rules.  \nRules don’t forbid bald eagle eating bear, but also don’t say it happens.  \nBut the question: “The bald eagle does not eat the bear” — is that true?  \n\nWe can’t deduce bald eagle eats bear, so “bald eagle does not eat the bear” is not necessarily true unless we can prove it’s impossible.  \n\nBut maybe we can prove it’s impossible:  \n• The only eater in the story is the tiger (tiger eats the bear, from rule 11).  \n\n• No other “eats” relation appears.  \n\n• So bald eagle eating bear is not stated and not implied by any rule.  \n\n• But is it possible? The rules don’t say only tiger can eat bear.  \n\nBut in logic, if it’s not stated, we can’t assume it’s false.  \nHowever, in these puzzles, usually “eats” relations are only those derivable.  \nIf no rule says bald eagle eats bear, then “bald eagle does not eat the bear” is true in the closed-world reasoning of these puzzles.  \n\nBut careful: Some puzzles treat “unknown” if not stated.  \nHere, since tiger eats bear is stated, and no other eats involving bear is stated, bald eagle does not eat bear is true in the sense that it’s not the case that bald eagle eats bear.  \n\nBut the statement is “The bald eagle does not eat the bear” — that is the same as “It is not true that bald eagle eats bear.”  \nSince we cannot prove bald eagle eats bear, and the default in logic is that something is false unless proven, then “bald eagle does not eat the bear” is true.  \n\nStep 5 – Check for contradiction  \nCould bald eagle eat the bear?  \nNo rule says chasing → eating, except for chasing tiger.  \nSo no.  \n\nThus:  \n• Tiger eats bear (fact).  \n\n• Bald eagle does not eat bear (since no rule says so).  \n\nSo statement “The bald eagle does not eat the bear” is true.  \n\nFinal answer:  \nThe correct option is: A"

Tiger visiting mouse is solid from rule 18.  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

If someone is red → they are cold.  \n\nStep 1 – Apply rules to Gary.  \nGary is big (fact 10).  \nFrom R4: Big → red. So Gary is red.  \nFrom R6: Red → cold. So Gary is cold.  \n\nSo Gary is big, red, cold.  \n\nStep 2 – Check if Gary is furry.  \nR1 says: red and cold → furry.  \nGary is red and cold, so Gary is furry.  \n\nR2 says: furry → round. So Gary is round.  \n\nR5 says: round → quiet. But we already know Gary is quiet (fact 11), so consistent.  \n\nStep 3 – Can we determine if Gary is white?  \nNo fact says anything about Gary’s whiteness except:  \nCharlie is not white (fact 8), but that’s about Charlie, not Gary.  \n\nNo rule links color red/white or cold/white or big/white.  \nWe know:  \n• Gary is red (from R4).  \n\n• If someone is red, can they be white? Possibly if “white” means “has white color” in addition to red? But in logic puzzles, “white” and “red” are usually mutually exclusive color properties (like an object can’t be entirely red and entirely white unless stated otherwise). But here, “white” might mean “is white” as a color property of the person. If “red” and “white” are contradictory (since Charlie is red and not white), likely “red” implies “not white” in this puzzle’s world.  \n\nCheck: Charlie is red and not white. Is that just about Charlie or general?  \nNo general rule says “red → not white” explicitly, but in logic puzzles, color labels are often treated as mutually exclusive unless combined (like “red and white” means both colors present). But here, “white” probably means “is white” as a whole (like Charlie is not white means Charlie’s color is not white). If Gary is red, then Gary’s color is red, so Gary is not white.  \n\nSo:  \nFrom R4: big → red.  \nFrom Charlie’s case: red means not white (since they pointed out Charlie is not white despite being red, implying red excludes white).  \n\nThus: Gary is red → Gary is not white.  \n\nSo statement “Gary is white” is false.  \n\nStep 4 – Conclusion.  \nGary is white = false.  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

Then Dave is young, white, round, smart, and blue. That’s consistent with fact 1 (Dave is blue). So maybe Dave could be red.  \n\nBut we must check if the facts force Dave not to be red.  \n\nWe know nothing else about Dave except he is blue.  \nCould we deduce Dave’s color from other rules?  \n\nRule R1: All smart, round people are blue.  \nRule R5: If someone is young and smart then they are blue.  \n\nBut we don’t know if Dave is smart or round or young.  \n\nSo: We know Dave is blue, but we don’t know if he is red.  \nCould Dave be red? Possibly yes, unless something forces blue → not red.  \n\nIs there such a rule?  \n\nCheck: If someone is red, they are young (R3), and if young, they are white (R8), and if white, they are smart (R6), and if young, they are round (R7), and if smart and round, they are blue (R1).  \n\nSo red → blue.  \n\nSo if Dave is red, then Dave is blue. That’s fine; it’s consistent.  \n\nBut what about the converse? If Dave is blue, does that imply he is red? No, not necessarily.  \n\nSo Dave could be blue without being red.  \n\nWe have no info that Dave is red.  \n\nSo the statement “Dave is red” is not necessarily true. Is it false?  \n\nWe’d need to prove Dave is not red.  \n\nCan we prove Dave is not red?  \n\nSuppose Dave is red. Then Dave is young, white, round, smart, blue.  \nNo contradiction with fact 1 (Dave is blue).  \n\nSo it’s possible in the logic.  \n\nBut is it possible given all facts? The facts about Erin, Fiona, Harry don’t mention Dave, so Dave’s properties beyond “blue” are unknown.  \n\nThus, we cannot conclude Dave is red, nor that Dave is not red.  \n\nSo the answer should be unknown.  \n\nBut wait — check options:  \nA) True  \nB) False  \nC) Unknown  \n\nWe chose C? Let’s double-check constraints.  \n\nCould “blue” and “red” be exclusive?

That means Erin is both red and blue.  \n\nYes! Erin is explicitly red (fact 2) and also smart and round (facts 3,4) → Erin is blue by R1.  \n\nSo a person can be both red and blue.  \n\nSo Dave being blue doesn’t prevent him from being red.  \n\nBut do we have any evidence Dave is red?

The lion is cold.  \n6. The lion likes the cat.  \n7. The lion needs the mouse.  \n8. The lion visits the mouse.  \n9. The mouse is cold.  \n10. The mouse is red.  \n11. The mouse is young.  \n12. The mouse likes the cat.  \n13. The mouse needs the cat.  \n14. The mouse needs the cow.  \n\nRules from context:\n\nR1: If something needs the cat and the cat is red then it is blue.  \nR2: Blue things are red.  \nR3: If something likes the mouse and the mouse likes the cat then the cat is blue.  \nR4: If something is cold and red then it likes the mouse.  \nR5: If something needs the cow and it is cold then it is young.  \nR6: If something is nice then it visits the lion.  \nR7: If something needs the lion then it likes the cat.  \nR8: If something visits the cat and it likes the lion then the cat is blue.  \nR9: If something is cold and blue then it needs the lion.  \n\nQuestion: Does the mouse need the mouse?  \n\nThis is a reflexive “needs” relation. The facts list what each thing needs, but none say anything needs itself.  \nWe must check if the rules force the mouse to need itself.  \n\nCheck rules:\n\n• R1: “If something needs the cat and the cat is red then it is blue.”  \n\n  But the cat is not stated to be red, so not triggered.  \n\n• R2: “Blue things are red” — property inheritance, but not relevant unless something is blue.  \n\n• R3: “If something likes the mouse and the mouse likes the cat then the cat is blue.”  \n\n  The lion likes the cat? Wait: The lion likes the cat (fact 6). Does the lion like the mouse? Not stated.  \n  The cow likes the lion, not the mouse. The cat visits the mouse, but not said to like the mouse.  \n  The mouse likes the cat (fact 12), but “something” here must like the mouse.  \n  Check: The lion is cold and red? Lion is cold (fact 5), but is the lion red? Not stated.  \n  R4: If something is cold and red then it likes the mouse.  \n  The lion is cold, but is it red? Unknown. The mouse is cold and red (facts 9, 10), so the mouse satisfies R4’s condition:  \n  The mouse is cold and red → the mouse likes the mouse?  \n  Wait: R4 says: “If something is cold and red then it likes the mouse.”  \n  So: The mouse is cold and red → the mouse likes the mouse.  \n  Yes! That’s important.  \n\nSo from R4:  \nMouse is cold and red → Mouse likes the mouse.  \n\nNow R3: “If something likes the mouse and the mouse likes the cat then the cat is blue.”  \nHere “something” = mouse (since mouse likes the mouse from above).  \nMouse likes the mouse (from R4) and mouse likes the cat (fact 12) → then the cat is blue.  \n\nSo cat is blue.  \n\nR2: Blue things are red → cat is red.  \n\nNow R1: If something needs the cat and the cat is red then it is blue.  \nThe mouse needs the cat (fact 13) and the cat is red → the mouse is blue.  \n\nSo mouse is blue.  \n\nR9: If something is cold and blue then it needs the lion.  \nMouse is cold and blue → mouse needs the lion.  \n\nBut we already have: mouse needs the cat, needs the cow. Now also needs the lion.  \n\nBut none of this implies “mouse needs the mouse.”  \n\nThe rules never force a reflexive need.  \nNo rule says: If X likes Y then X needs X, etc.  \nSo the statement “The mouse needs the mouse” is not given in facts, and not deducible from rules.  \n\nThus it is false that the mouse needs the mouse (since it’s not true in the model given; needs relations are explicitly listed or derived, and this is not).  \n\nFinal:  \nThe correct option is: B"

If something is red then it is kind.  \n17. If something is round and nice then it is not big.\n\nStep 1 – Check contradictions in given facts about Charlie.\n\nCharlie is big (8) and kind (9).  \n\nRule 15: If Charlie is nice and Charlie is big → Charlie is not kind.  \nBut Charlie is kind, so to avoid contradiction, Charlie cannot be both nice and big.  \nSince Charlie is big, Charlie cannot be nice.  \nSo: Charlie is not nice.\n\nStep 2 – Check Anne.\n\nAnne is red (2).  \nRule 16: If something is red → it is kind. So Anne is kind.  \nAnne is red and kind → Rule 12: All kind, red things are rough.  \nSo Anne is rough.  \nRule 14: If something is rough → it is round. So Anne is round.  \nRule 11: All round things are nice. So Anne is nice.  \n\nNo contradictions for Anne.\n\nStep 3 – Check Bob.\n\nBob is round (7) → Bob is nice (Rule 11). (Matches fact 4.)  \nBob is kind (3).  \nBob is not red (6).  \nSo Bob is kind but not red → Rule 12 doesn’t apply (requires kind AND red).  \nSo we don’t know if Bob is rough unless we find another path.\n\nIs Bob rough?  \nRule 14: rough → round. But round does not imply rough necessarily.  \nNo rule says kind+round → rough.  \nSo Bob’s roughness is unknown from given.\n\nStep 4 – Check Fiona.\n\nFiona is quiet (10).  \nWe know nothing else about Fiona’s color, kind status, roundness, or roughness.\n\nRule 13: big → quiet. But quiet does not imply big.  \nRule 17: round and nice → not big. But that doesn’t help.\n\nWe need to see if Fiona must be rough or not rough.\n\nStep 5 – Can Fiona be rough?\n\nIf Fiona were rough (Rule 14) → Fiona is round → (Rule 11) Fiona is nice.  \nBut is that possible? Yes, nothing forbids Fiona from being round and nice.  \nBut is she necessarily rough? No.  \n\nCould she be not rough? Yes, she could be not red, for example.  \nIf she’s not red, then even if she’s kind, she might not be rough (Rule 12 requires kind AND red).  \n\nBut we don’t know if Fiona is kind or red.  \n\nSo Fiona’s roughness is unknown unless something forces it.\n\nStep 6 – Check if quiet + something else → rough.\n\nNo rule links quiet directly to rough.  \nBig → quiet, but Fiona’s bigness is unknown.  \nSo no chain of deduction to determine if Fiona is rough or not.\n\nThus, “Fiona is not rough” is unknown.\n\nStep 7 – Conclusion\n\nThe statement’s truth value is unknown.\n\nThe correct option is: C"

The rabbit eats the dog.  \n5. The rabbit is green.  \n6. The tiger chases the rabbit.  \n7. The tiger is big.  \n\nConditional rules:  \n8. If something is nice and it eats the tiger then it needs the dog.  \n9. If something chases the cat then it eats the cat.  \n10. If the dog chases the tiger then the tiger needs the rabbit.  \n11. If the rabbit chases the tiger then the rabbit chases the cat.  \n12. If something chases the cat then the cat is kind.  \n13. If something eats the dog then it chases the cat.  \n14. If something is rough then it eats the dog.  \n15. If something is kind then it is rough.  \n16. If something eats the rabbit and the rabbit is big then it is kind.  \n\nStep 1 – Apply rule 15 to the dog.  \nDog is kind (fact 2) → Dog is rough (rule 15).  \n\nStep 2 – Apply rule 14 to the dog.  \nDog is rough → Dog eats the dog? That’s impossible (something can’t eat itself in normal logic).  \nSo maybe rule 14 means: If X is rough, then X eats the dog. But if X = dog, then dog eats the dog — nonsense.  \nSo “something” in these rules probably refers to other entities unless forced. But maybe “something” can be the dog? Let’s check:  \nRule 14: ∀x (Rough(x) → Eats(x, dog)).  \nIf x = dog: Rough(dog) → Eats(dog, dog) — impossible, so maybe “something” excludes itself? Usually in logic puzzles, “something” can be itself unless it leads to contradiction. But here, if dog is rough, then dog must eat the dog — impossible, so the puzzle might intend “something” to be something else? Wait, but that’s a contradiction already: dog is kind (fact 2) → dog is rough (rule 15) → dog eats the dog (rule 14) — impossible.  \n\nSo either the puzzle is inconsistent, or “something” means “some entity (possibly different from dog)”? No, rule 14 says “If something is rough then it eats the dog” — universal: for all x. So dog is rough → dog eats the dog. Contradiction.  \n\nThus, maybe “something” means “some entity” but not necessarily distinct? Puzzles sometimes allow this, but then this is an immediate inconsistency unless “eats” is not reflexive.  \n\nBut maybe they mean: if something is rough, then there exists something that eats the dog? No, wording: “If something is rough then it eats the dog” means that same thing eats the dog.  \n\nSo dog is rough → dog eats the dog — impossible. So the set of facts is inconsistent.  \n\nBut maybe “dog” in rule 14 refers to the animal dog, not necessarily the dog mentioned earlier? No, it’s “the dog” = specific dog.  \n\nSo the only escape: dog is kind → dog is rough → dog eats the dog — impossible. So the puzzle is inconsistent.  \n\nBut if inconsistent, any statement is vacuously true? They wouldn’t intend that. Let’s check: maybe “the dog” in rule 14 is not the same as the dog in the facts? No, it’s the same dog.  \n\nSo maybe I misread: rule 14: “If something is rough then it eats the dog.”  \nRule 15: “If something is kind then it is rough.”  \n\nSo dog is kind → dog is rough → dog eats the dog. Contradiction.  \n\nThus, the statements are inconsistent. But maybe they want us to ignore the inconsistency for the cat question.  \n\nStep 3 – Determine if cat is rough.  \n\nWe know: dog is kind → dog is rough.  \n\nCat: is cat kind?  \nRule 12: If something chases the cat then the cat is kind.  \nDo we know if something chases the cat? No direct info.  \n\nBut rabbit eats the dog (fact 4) → rabbit chases the cat (rule 13).  \nSo rabbit chases the cat.  \n\nThus, by rule 12: cat is kind.  \n\nThen rule 15: cat is kind → cat is rough.  \n\nSo cat is rough.  \n\nThe statement in question: “The cat is not rough” — that is false.  \n\nStep 4 – Conclusion.  \n\nCat is rough, so “The cat is not rough” is false.  \n\nThe correct option is: B"

No direct fact says so.  \n\nCheck if any rule forces the cat to chase the rabbit:  \n\n• R1: If something visits the cow → it chases the rabbit. Does the cat visit the cow? Not stated.  \n\n• R4: If something chases the cat → it visits the rabbit. That’s about the chaser of the cat (rabbit), not the cat.  \n\n• R5: If something visits the rabbit → it sees the cow. Not relevant unless cat visits rabbit.  \n\n• R6: If something chases the cat and it sees the cow → cow chases cat. Not relevant to cat chasing rabbit.  \n\n• R7: If something sees the rabbit and it chases the cat → rabbit chases squirrel. Not relevant to cat chasing rabbit.  \n\nNo rule says that if X chases cow then X chases rabbit.  \nNo rule forces cat to chase rabbit.  \n\nWe only know: cat chases cow (from R2 triggered by rabbit chasing cat).  \nWe have no fact or rule that would make the cat chase the rabbit.  \n\nSo \"The cat does not chase the rabbit\" is true (since we can’t derive that the cat chases the rabbit, and the default is that it doesn’t, unless forced by rules).  \n\nWait — but is it possible the cat chases the rabbit? Let’s check if any rule could make it happen.  \n\nWhat would make cat chase rabbit?  \n• R1: If cat visits cow → cat chases rabbit. But we don’t know if cat visits cow.  \n\n• Any other rule? No.  \n\nSo it’s unknown whether cat visits cow, so unknown if R1 applies.  \nThus we cannot prove cat chases rabbit, and cannot prove cat does not chase rabbit unless we assume absence of evidence means false. But in logic, \"does not chase\" means we know it’s false that it chases.  \n\nActually, careful: The statement is \"The cat does not chase the rabbit.\"  \nWe need to know if it’s true (i.e., cat definitely does not chase rabbit), false (cat does chase rabbit), or unknown.  \n\nSince we can’t prove cat chases rabbit, and can’t prove no situation yields cat chasing rabbit (because maybe cat visits cow, which we don’t know), the truth value is unknown.  \n\nBut — do we know if cat visits cow? No.  \nCould cat visit cow? Possibly, but not stated. Without that, R1 doesn’t trigger.  \nSo cat chasing rabbit is not entailed by given facts.  \n\nBut the statement is \"The cat does not chase the rabbit.\" For it to be true, we must be sure the cat never chases rabbit in all models of the facts.  \nBut maybe cat visits cow in some models consistent with facts (since it’s not stated that cat doesn’t visit cow). If cat visits cow, then by R1, cat chases rabbit, making the statement false.  \nSo it’s not necessarily true.  \n\nThus, since it can be true or false depending on unknown \"cat visits cow\", the answer is unknown.  \n\nFinal answer:  \nThe correct option is: C"

List known facts about Erin from context:  \n• Erin is big.  \n\n• Erin is white.  \n\nNo other direct property is given about Erin (like furry, rough, round, smart, quiet) except \"big\" and \"white\".  \n\n2. Apply rules to Erin to deduce more properties.  \n\nFrom context:  \n• \"All white, big things are round.\"  \n\nErin is white and big → Erin is round.  \n\nFrom context:  \n• \"If something is round then it is big.\" (This is already satisfied; Erin is big.)  \n\nFrom context:  \n• \"White, furry things are round.\" (Doesn’t apply to Erin yet because we don’t know if Erin is furry.)  \n\nFrom context:  \n• \"If something is rough and round then it is smart.\" (We don’t yet know if Erin is rough.)  \n\nFrom context:  \n• \"If something is furry then it is rough.\" (Again, furry unknown.)  \n\nFrom context:  \n• \"All rough, big things are smart.\"  \n\nErin is big. If Erin is rough, then Erin is smart. But is Erin rough?  \n\nWe can check:  \nFrom \"White, furry things are round\" — Erin is round and white, does that imply furry? No, that’s not reversible.  \n\nFrom \"Rough, furry things are smart\" — not directly helpful without furry/rough info.  \n\nSo we can’t deduce Erin is rough or furry from given facts.  \n\n3. Check if Erin’s quietness can be determined.  \n\nWe know Gary is quiet, round, smart, white. But that’s just Gary.  \nNo rule links \"big\", \"white\", \"round\" to \"quiet\" or \"not quiet\".  \n\nSo Erin’s quietness is unknown unless we can deduce a contradiction with \"Erin is quiet\" or \"Erin is not quiet\".  \n\nTest \"Erin is not quiet\":  \n• Could Erin be quiet? Possibly, since quiet property is independent here.  \n\n• Could Erin be not quiet? Possibly, since no rule forces quiet.  \n\nThus, it’s unknown.  \n\n4. But wait — check if Erin must be smart (which might link to quietness? No, no link).  \n\nActually, maybe there’s a path:  \nWe know: \"All rough, big things are smart.\"  \nWe know: \"If something is furry then it is rough.\"  \nWe know: \"White, furry things are round.\"  \n\nIf Erin were furry:  \n• Erin white and furry → round (already known).  \n\n• Furry → rough.  \n\n• Rough and big → smart.  \n\nBut we don’t know if Erin is furry.  \n\nWhat about: \"Round, rough things are smart\" — same as earlier.  \n\nBut maybe \"All white, big things are round\" plus another rule?  \n\nRule: \"If something is round then it is big\" — no help for roughness.  \n\nNo rule forces Erin to be rough.  \n\nThus, Erin’s roughness is unknown, so Erin’s smartness is unknown.  \n\nQuietness is totally unrelated in the given facts.  \n\n5. Conclusion:  \nWe cannot determine if Erin is quiet or not quiet.  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

If something chases the cat then it sees the dog.  \n\nStep 2 – Question: The tiger does not see the dog.  \n\nWe need to know if \"tiger sees the dog\" is true or false.  \n\nFrom the facts:  \n• We know tiger eats the dog (fact 10).  \n\n• But nothing directly says tiger sees the dog.  \n\n• Rule 19: If tiger is green and tiger is big → tiger sees the dog.  \n\n• We don’t know if tiger is green.  \n\n• We don’t know if tiger is big.  \n\nStep 3 – Check other rules that could force tiger to see the dog  \n\nRule 18: If something sees the dog and it chases the tiger → tiger chases the dog.  \nBut that doesn’t say tiger sees the dog, only that tiger chases the dog.  \n\nRule 14: If something sees the mouse then it is big. Not relevant unless we know tiger sees the mouse.  \n\nRule 13: If something sees the mouse and eats the mouse → mouse sees the tiger.  \nBut mouse does not see the tiger (fact 9).  \nSo: For any X, it cannot be true that (X sees the mouse and X eats the mouse) because that would force mouse sees the tiger (contradiction with fact 9).  \nSo no one both sees and eats the mouse.  \n\nStep 4 – Could tiger see the dog by chasing something?  \n\nNo rule says chasing something implies seeing something else except:  \nRule 20: If something chases the cat → it sees the dog.  \nDoes tiger chase the cat? Unknown.  \n\nFrom fact 3: cat chases tiger. Not the reverse.  \n\nRule 15: If something chases the dog → dog chases the cat.  \nFrom fact 1: cat chases the dog → so dog chases the cat.  \n\nRule 18: If something sees the dog and it chases the tiger → tiger chases the dog.  \nWe need an X that sees the dog and chases the tiger.  \nCat chases tiger (fact 3). Does cat see the dog? Unknown.  \n\nStep 5 – Try to deduce if cat sees the dog  \n\nRule 20: If something chases the cat → it sees the dog.  \nWho chases the cat? Dog chases the cat (from step 4 deduction).  \nSo dog sees the dog? That’s trivial (self-seeing? not necessarily stated, but maybe irrelevant).  \nActually, dog sees the cat (fact 6). But dog chasing cat → from rule 20, dog sees the dog? That’s not useful.  \n\nRule 20 says: if X chases the cat → X sees the dog.  \nSo dog chases cat → dog sees the dog. That’s not about tiger.  \n\nStep 6 – Could tiger see the dog via being big and green?  \n\nWe don’t know tiger is big.  \nWe don’t know tiger is green.  \nSo rule 19 doesn’t apply.  \n\nNo other rule forces tiger to see the dog.  \n\nStep 7 – Could tiger not see the dog be proven?  \n\nWe’d need a rule like: If tiger is nice then tiger does not see the dog. But no such rule.  \nSo we cannot prove \"tiger does not see the dog\" either.  \n\nStep 8 – Conclusion  \n\nWe cannot determine whether tiger sees the dog.  \nSo \"The tiger does not see the dog\" is unknown in truth value.  \n\nThe correct option is: C"

All blue things are furry.  \n   → Fiona is blue (from rule 1) ⇒ Fiona is furry.  \n\nDeductions about Fiona:\n• Fiona is green ⇒ blue (rule 1).  \n\n• Fiona is blue ⇒ furry (rule 8).  \n\n• Fiona is furry and blue ⇒ round (rule 4).  \n\n• Fiona is round ⇒ red (rule 6).  \n\nSo: Fiona is green → blue → furry → (furry & blue) → round → red.  \n\nThus Fiona is red.  \n\nCheck contradictions:\n• Rule 2 says: round and cold ⇒ red. Fiona is cold and round, so consistent.  \n\n• No rule says red and green can’t both be true.  \n\nConclusion: The statement “Fiona is red” is true.\n\nThe correct option is: A"
