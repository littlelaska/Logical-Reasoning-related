The raven is to the left of the hummingbird.\n   • This means in the order, raven comes before hummingbird.\n\n   \n2.

Tractor is the second-newest.  \n   That means in order from oldest (1) to newest (5), T is 4th newest → 2nd oldest? Wait, careful:  \n   \"Second-newest\" means: newest is 5th, second-newest is 4th in age order (where 1=oldest, 5=newest).  \n   So: T = position 4.\n\n2. Limousine is newer than Hatchback.  \n   L > H (in newness, meaning L is more recent than H).\n\n3. Limousine is older than Sedan.  \n   S > L.\n\n4. Minivan is newer than Sedan.  \n   M > S.\n\nFrom 2, 3, 4:  \nM > S > L > H  (in newness: M newest among these four, then S, then L, then H oldest among these four).\n\nSo ordering so far:  \nWe know T is 4th (second-newest).

Possibly M is in position 5. Let’s test:  \n\nIf M is 5 (newest), then S must be less than 5 but greater than L, and L greater than H.  \nAlso T is 4. So S cannot be 5 (M is 5), S cannot be 4 (T is 4), so S can be 3 or 2 or 1? But S > L > H, so S cannot be 1 or 2 unless L and H are even older.

So S must be less than M, and M is 5 (since M is newer than S and only position 5 is newer than T=4).  \n\nThus: M=5, S=3 (because S can’t be 4, T is 4; S can’t be 2 because S > L > H and L would have to be 1 and H would be ???

    "reasoning_cot": "Let’s reason step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 vehicles:  \nTractor (T), Truck (TK), Bus (B), Minivan (M), Convertible (C).  \n\nStatements:  \n1. Bus is newer than Tractor → B > T (in newness, \">\" means newer).  \n2. Convertible is older than Tractor → T > C.  \n3. Truck is the second-newest → TK is #2 in age ranking (1=newest, 5=oldest).  \n4. Minivan is older than Convertible → C > M.  \n\nFrom (2) and (4): T > C > M. So T is older than C, and C is older than M.  \nSo M is older than C, C is older than T? Wait — check: \"older than\" means earlier in age, so if X is older than Y, then X < Y in \"newness\" ranking.  \n\nLet’s rewrite carefully:  \n\nLet 1 = newest, 5 = oldest.  \n\n(1) B newer than T → B < T (in rank number, smaller rank = newer).  \n(2) C older than T → C > T (in rank number).  \n(3) TK is 2nd-newest → TK rank = 2.  \n(4) M older than C → M > C.  \n\nFrom (2) C > T, (4) M > C, so M > C > T.  \nSo in age: M older than C older than T. In newness ranking: T newer than C newer than M.  \n\nSo T < C < M in newness? No — careful: In newness rank (1=newest, 5=oldest), newer means smaller number.  \nIf M older than C: M has bigger rank than C.  \nIf C older than T: C has bigger rank than T.  \nSo: M > C > T in rank number (i.e., M oldest among these three, then C, then T).  \n\nSo we know: M is older than C, C is older than T.  \n\nNow B is newer than T: B < T.  \n\nSo B is newer than T, and T is newer than C, and C is newer than M.  \nSo newness order: B < T < C < M (in rank numbers: B smallest, then T, then C, then M largest among these four).  \n\nBut we have 5 vehicles: B, T, C, M, TK.  \n\nTK is fixed at rank 2.  \n\nSo possible ranks: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  \n\nTK = 2.  \n\nB < T < C < M in rank numbers (meaning B newest of these four, then T, then C, then M oldest of these four).  \n\nWhere can B be? B is newer than T, so B could be rank 1.  \n\nLet’s test: If B = 1, T = 3, C = 4, M = 5, TK = 2.  \nCheck: B=1 < T=3 ✔, C=4 > T=3? No — that’s wrong: C should be > T (older), but here C=4, T=3 → C > T ✔ yes (4>3). Wait, I reversed: C > T means C older, so C’s rank number bigger than T’s. Yes, 4>3 ✔.  \nM=5 > C=4 ✔.  \nTK=2 ✔.  \n\nSo ranks:  \n1: B  \n2: TK  \n3: T  \n4: C  \n5: M  \n\nCheck all:  \n• B newer than T: 1 < 3 ✔  \n\n• C older than T: 4 > 3 ✔  \n\n• M older than C: 5 > 4 ✔  \n\n• TK 2nd-newest ✔  \n\nSo third-newest is rank 3 = Tractor.  \n\nThus correct: A) The tractor is the third-newest.  \n\nThe correct option is: A"
