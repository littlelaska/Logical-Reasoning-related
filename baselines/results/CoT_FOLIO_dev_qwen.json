    "predicted_reasoning": "Let's break down the information step by step to determine if the statement \"Bonnie performs in school talent shows often\" is true, false, or uncertain.\n\n1. **Understanding the given statements:**\n   - If people perform in school talent shows often, then they attend and are very engaged with school events.\n   - People either perform in school talent shows often or are inactive and disinterested members of their community.\n   - If people chaperone high school dances, then they are not students who attend the school.\n   - All people who are inactive and disinterested members of their community chaperone high school dances.\n   - All young children and teenagers who wish to further their academic careers and educational opportunities are students who attend the school.\n   - Bonnie either both attends and is very engaged with school events and is a student who attends the school, or she neither attends and is very engaged with school events nor is a student who attends the school.\n\n2. **Analyzing Bonnie's situation:**\n   - According to the second statement, Bonnie must either perform in school talent shows often or be an inactive and disinterested member of her community.\n   - If Bonnie is an inactive and disinterested member of her community, then according to the fourth statement, she would chaperone high school dances.\n   - If Bonnie chaperones high school dances, then according to the third statement, she cannot be a student who attends the school.\n   - If Bonnie is not a student who attends the school, then according to the fifth statement, she cannot be a young child or teenager who wishes to further their academic careers and educational opportunities.\n   - Since Bonnie is a young child or teenager (implied by the context), this creates a contradiction.

However, this case contradicts the first part of the conditional statement (\"if dried Thai chilies are spicy or a bakery\"). Therefore, dried Thai chilies cannot be a bakery.\n\n8. **Conclusion from the cases:**\n   - Since dried Thai chilies cannot be a bakery (as per the contradiction in Case 2), the only remaining possibility is that dried Thai chilies are spicy. If they are spicy, then according to the context, they could be a hotpot.\n\nGiven the analysis, we conclude that dried Thai chilies are either spicy or a hotpot, which aligns with the statement that if they are spicy or a bakery, they are a hotpot or spicy. Since they cannot be a bakery, they must be spicy, making them a hotpot.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"Dried Thai chilies are a hotpot\" is true.",

The security deposit can be either equal to one month's rent or more.\n   - Since the monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000, the minimum security deposit required would be $2000 (equal to one month's rent).\n\n2. **Fluffy and Tom**: Fluffy is Tom's cat, and cats are pets. The Olive Garden is a managed building.\n   - This information is relevant to Tom renting an apartment but doesn't directly affect the deposit amount.\n\n3. **Tom's Condition for Renting**: Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if and only if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.\n   - Given that the minimum deposit is $2000, it is impossible for Tom to meet this condition because $2000 is more than $1500.\n\n4. **Security Deposit at Olive Garden**: The statement we need to evaluate is \"The security deposit at the Olive Garden is either $2000 or more.\"\n   - According to the rules provided, the deposit must be at least $2000, which aligns with the statement.\n\nBased on the analysis, the security deposit at the Olive Garden is indeed $2000 or more, as it cannot be less than $2000.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is: A) True"
