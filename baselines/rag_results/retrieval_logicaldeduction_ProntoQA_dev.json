Facts given directly:  \n• 7 golfers: Ada, Amy, Eli, Rob, Joe, Eve, Ana.  \n\n• Rob finished 2nd. (This is a direct fact.)  \n\n• Rob finished above Eve → Eve is after Rob (positions 3–7).  \n\n• Joe finished above Ada.  \n\n• Joe finished below Eve → So order: Eve … Joe … Ada (but careful: \"Joe finished below Eve\" means Eve is above Joe; \"Joe finished above Ada\" means Joe is above Ada).

Wait, if Rob is above Eve, then Eve’s position > 2. So Eve is in {3,4,5,6,7}.  \n\nBut Eli is 5th. Could Eve be 5th? No, because Eli is 5th. So Eve is in {3,4,6,7}.  \n\n3. Possible positions for Eve:  \nIf Eve is 3rd or 4th, then Joe is below Eve (so Joe could be 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th) but must be above Ada. Ada above Ana.  \n\nAlso, Eve cannot be 5th (Eli’s spot).  \n\nIf Eve is 6th or 7th, then Joe would be below her (7th?) but then Ada below Joe — possible but let’s check constraints: Rob (2nd) above Eve means Eve’s position > 2, so 6th or 7th possible. But then Eve > Joe > Ada > Ana: if Eve is 6th, Joe 7th, Ada? impossible because only 7 spots. So Eve can’t be 6th with Joe below her unless Joe is 7th, but then Ada can’t be below Joe (no spot). So Eve must be high enough to fit Joe, Ada, Ana below her.  \n\nThus Eve must be 3rd or 4th.  \n\n4. Try Eve = 3rd:  \nThen Joe is below 3rd, above Ada.

But then Eve > Joe > Ada > Ana: if Eve is 6th, Joe 7th, Ada? impossible because only 7 spots. So Eve can’t be 6th with Joe below her unless Joe is 7th, but then Ada can’t be below Joe (no spot).

(This is a direct fact.)  \n\n• Rob finished above Eve → Eve is after Rob (positions 3–7).  \n\n• Joe finished above Ada.  \n\n• Joe finished below Eve → So order: Eve … Joe … Ada (but careful: \"Joe finished below Eve\" means Eve is above Joe; \"Joe finished above Ada\" means Joe is above Ada).

Possible positions for Eve:  \nIf Eve is 3rd or 4th, then Joe is below Eve (so Joe could be 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th) but must be above Ada. Ada above Ana.  \n\nAlso, Eve cannot be 5th (Eli’s spot).  \n\nIf Eve is 6th or 7th, then Joe would be below her (7th?) but then Ada below Joe — possible but let’s check constraints: Rob (2nd) above Eve means Eve’s position > 2, so 6th or 7th possible. But then Eve > Joe > Ada > Ana: if Eve is 6th, Joe 7th, Ada? impossible because only 7 spots. So Eve can’t be 6th with Joe below her unless Joe is 7th, but then Ada can’t be below Joe (no spot). So Eve must be high enough to fit Joe, Ada, Ana below her.  \n\nThus Eve must be 3rd or 4th.  \n\n4. Try Eve = 3rd:  \nThen Joe is below 3rd, above Ada.

Dan finished last (5th).  \n\nFrom (3) and (2):  \nEli < Amy < Mel in terms of positions (smaller number = better finish).  \n\nSo: Eli finished above Amy, Amy above Mel.  \n\nKnown positions:  \n• Position 1: Mya  \n\n• Position 5: Dan  \n\nSo available positions: 2, 3, 4.  \n\nWe must place Eli, Amy, Mel in order: Eli → Amy → Mel in that ranking sequence.  \n\nThat means:  \nEli must be in a position before Amy, Amy before Mel.  \n\nPossible arrangement of positions 2, 3, 4:  \nEli must be in the best of these three (position 2), Amy in the middle (position 3), Mel in position 4.  \n\nCheck:  \n1: Mya  \n2: Eli  \n3: Amy  \n4: Mel  \n5: Dan  \n\nThis satisfies:  \n• Amy above Mel (3 vs 4) ✅  \n\n• Amy below Eli (3 vs 2) ✅  \n\n• Mya 1st ✅  \n\n• Dan last ✅  \n\nSo Amy finished third.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\n"}

But Dan is 2nd, so Eve cannot be 1st or 2nd.  \n\nFrom (2) Eve > Amy and (4) Amy > Eli:  \nEve > Amy > Eli.  \n\nSo Eve must be above both Amy and Eli.  \n\nAlso, since Dan (2nd) > Eve, Eve cannot be 3rd if 2nd > 3rd, but wait — 2nd is above 3rd, so Eve could be 3rd. Let’s check:  \n\nIf Eve is 3rd → Amy is below Eve (4th or 5th) and Amy > Eli → Amy could be 4th, Eli 5th.  \nThen positions: 1st = ?, 2nd = Dan, 3rd = Eve, 4th = Amy, 5th = Eli.  \nThat works: Dan > Eve ✓, Eve > Amy ✓, Amy > Eli ✓.  \n\nWho is 1st? Only Rob remains for 1st.  \n\nCheck other possibilities: Could Eve be 4th?  \nIf Eve 4th → Amy 5th (since Amy below Eve) → but Amy > Eli would mean Eli below Amy, but 5th is last, so impossible (Eli would have to be 6th). So Eve cannot be 4th or 5th.  \n\nThus only possibility: Eve is 3rd, Amy 4th, Eli 5th, Dan 2nd, Rob 1st.  \n\nSo 1st place is Rob.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\n"}

So Eve cannot be 4th or 5th.  \n\nThus only possibility: Eve is 3rd, Amy 4th, Eli 5th, Dan 2nd, Rob 1st.  \n\nSo 1st place is Rob.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\n"}

But position 3 is Kiwis, so P cannot be 3 (Kiwis fixed).  \n\nCheck possibility: C = 1, P = 2, O = 5? No, because O could be 4 or 5, but position 4 is Loquats, so O could be 5.

We have three vehicles: sedan, minivan, motorcycle.  \n2. Motorcycle is the second-newest.  \n   • This means there is one vehicle newer than the motorcycle and one older than the motorcycle.  \n\n3. Minivan is newer than the motorcycle.  \n   • So minivan must be the newest (since motorcycle is second-newest, the only newer vehicle is the newest one).  \n\n4. Therefore, the order from newest to oldest is: minivan (newest), motorcycle (second-newest), sedan (oldest).  \n\nSo the sedan is the oldest.  \n\nThe correct option is: A\nAnswer:\nA\n\n"}

Ana finished below Mya. (Mya > Ana in ranking; lower rank = worse finish)  \n2. Dan finished above Amy. (Dan > Amy)  \n3. Mya finished second-to-last. (Mya is 4th place out of 5)  \n4. Eve finished below Amy. (Amy > Eve)  \n\nStep 1 – Place Mya.  \nMya is 4th (second-to-last).  \n\nStep 2 – Use “Ana finished below Mya.”  \nIf Mya is 4th, Ana must be below Mya → Ana must be 5th (last).  \n\nStep 3 – Use “Dan finished above Amy” and “Eve finished below Amy.”  \nOrder: Dan > Amy > Eve.  \n\nStep 4 – Assign positions.  \nWe have 5 positions: 1 (best) to 5 (worst).  \n• 4th = Mya  \n\n• 5th = Ana  \n\nRemaining positions: 1, 2, 3.  \nRemaining golfers: Dan, Amy, Eve.  \n\nFrom Dan > Amy > Eve:  \n• Dan must be in the highest available of {1, 2, 3} → possibly 1st.  \n\n• Amy must be below Dan but above Eve.  \n\n• Eve must be last among these three, but Ana is already 5th, so Eve must be 3rd? Wait, check:  \n\nIf Eve is 3rd, Amy must be above Eve → Amy could be 2nd, Dan 1st.  \nLet’s test:  \n1st: Dan  \n2nd: Amy  \n3rd: Eve  \n4th: Mya  \n5th: Ana  \n\nCheck all conditions:  \n1.

Eve (3rd) below Amy (2nd) ✅  \n\nIt works.  \n\nStep 5 – Second-to-last is 4th place = Mya.  \nThat’s given in the clues, so the option that says “Mya finished second-to-last” is simply stating a given fact, so it must be true.  \n\nStep 6 – Check the options.  \nOptions:  \nA) Ana finished second-to-last. → False, she finished last.  \nB) Amy finished second-to-last. → False, she finished 2nd.  \nC) Dan finished second-to-last. → False, he finished 1st.  \nD) Mya finished second-to-last. → True, given.  \nE) Eve finished second-to-last. → False, she finished 3rd.  \n\nThe correct option is: D\nAnswer:\nD\n\n"}

Facts given directly:  \n• 7 golfers: Ada, Amy, Eli, Rob, Joe, Eve, Ana.  \n\n• Rob finished 2nd. (This is a direct fact.)  \n\n• Rob finished above Eve → Eve is after Rob (positions 3–7).  \n\n• Joe finished above Ada.  \n\n• Joe finished below Eve → So order: Eve … Joe … Ada (but careful: \"Joe finished below Eve\" means Eve is above Joe; \"Joe finished above Ada\" means Joe is above Ada). So Eve > Joe > Ada.  \n\n• Ada finished above Ana → Ada > Ana.  \n\n• Eli finished 3rd-to-last → 7 total, 3rd-to-last = 5th place. So Eli is 5th.  \n\n2. Combine rankings:  \nFrom Eve > Joe > Ada > Ana.  \n\nRob is 2nd, so Eve cannot be 1st unless Eve is 1st? Let’s check: Rob (2nd) above Eve → Eve not 1st? Wait, if Rob is above Eve, then Eve’s position > 2. So Eve is in {3,4,5,6,7}.  \n\nBut Eli is 5th. Could Eve be 5th? No, because Eli is 5th. So Eve is in {3,4,6,7}.  \n\n3. Possible positions for Eve:  \nIf Eve is 3rd or 4th, then Joe is below Eve (so Joe could be 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th) but must be above Ada. Ada above Ana.  \n\nAlso, Eve cannot be 5th (Eli’s spot).  \n\nIf Eve is 6th or 7th, then Joe would be below her (7th?) but then Ada below Joe — possible but let’s check constraints: Rob (2nd) above Eve means Eve’s position > 2, so 6th or 7th possible. But then Eve > Joe > Ada > Ana: if Eve is 6th, Joe 7th, Ada? impossible because only 7 spots. So Eve can’t be 6th with Joe below her unless Joe is 7th, but then Ada can’t be below Joe (no spot). So Eve must be high enough to fit Joe, Ada, Ana below her.  \n\nThus Eve must be 3rd or 4th.  \n\n4. Try Eve = 3rd:  \nThen Joe is below 3rd, above Ada. Possible Joe = 4th, Ada = 5th or 6th, but Eli is 5th, so Ada can’t be 5th. So Ada = 6th, Ana = 7th.

So Orange in {4,6} (not 7 because Brown is at 7).  \n\nStep 3: Black and White constraint  \n• Black is to the right of White → Black > White in numbering.  \n\nStep 4: Try Orange at 4  \nIf Orange at 4: Green must be to the right of Orange → Green in {5,6,7}.  \nBut 5 is Blue, 7 is Brown, so Green must be at 6.  \nSo:  \nPos 4: Orange  \nPos 6: Green  \nPos 7: Brown  \nPos 5: Blue  \nPos 3: Gray  \n\nRemaining positions: 1, 2 for White and Black, but Black must be to the right of White.  \nIf White at 1, Black at 2 → works.  \n\nSo arrangement:  \n1: White  \n2: Black  \n3: Gray  \n4: Orange  \n5: Blue  \n6: Green  \n7: Brown  \n\nCheck all conditions:  \n• Brown rightmost ✓  \n\n• Black right of White (2 > 1) ✓  \n\n• Gray 3rd from left ✓  \n\n• Orange right of Gray (4 > 3) ✓  \n\n• Orange left of Green (4 < 6) ✓  \n\n• Blue 3rd from right (pos 5) ✓  \n\nStep 5: Which is second from the right?  \nPositions: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7  \nSecond from right = position 6 = Green.  \n\nSo the true statement: The green book is the second from the right.  \n\nFinal answer:  \nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}

Eve finished below Amy.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) Ana finished second-to-last.\nB) Amy finished second-to-last.\nC) Dan finished second-to-last.\nD) Mya finished second-to-last.\nE) Eve finished second-to-last.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason through the clues step-by-step.  \n\nFacts given:  \n1. Ana finished below Mya. (Mya > Ana in ranking; lower rank = worse finish)  \n2. Dan finished above Amy. (Dan > Amy)  \n3. Mya finished second-to-last. (Mya is 4th place out of 5)  \n4. Eve finished below Amy. (Amy > Eve)  \n\nStep 1 – Place Mya.  \nMya is 4th (second-to-last).  \n\nStep 2 – Use “Ana finished below Mya.”  \nIf Mya is 4th, Ana must be below Mya → Ana must be 5th (last).  \n\nStep 3 – Use “Dan finished above Amy” and “Eve finished below Amy.”  \nOrder: Dan > Amy > Eve.  \n\nStep 4 – Assign positions.  \nWe have 5 positions: 1 (best) to 5 (worst).  \n• 4th = Mya  \n\n• 5th = Ana  \n\nRemaining positions: 1, 2, 3.  \nRemaining golfers: Dan, Amy, Eve.  \n\nFrom Dan > Amy > Eve:  \n• Dan must be in the highest available of {1, 2, 3} → possibly 1st.  \n\n• Amy must be below Dan but above Eve.  \n\n• Eve must be last among these three, but Ana is already 5th, so Eve must be 3rd? Wait, check:  \n\nIf Eve is 3rd, Amy must be above Eve → Amy could be 2nd, Dan 1st.  \nLet’s test:  \n1st: Dan  \n2nd: Amy  \n3rd: Eve  \n4th: Mya  \n5th: Ana  \n\nCheck all conditions:  \n1. Ana (5th) below Mya (4th) ✅  \n2. Dan (1st) above Amy (2nd) ✅  \n3. Mya 4th ✅  \n4. Eve (3rd) below Amy (2nd) ✅  \n\nIt works.  \n\nStep 5 – Second-to-last is 4th place = Mya.  \nThat’s given in the clues, so the option that says “Mya finished second-to-last” is simply stating a given fact, so it must be true.  \n\nStep 6 – Check the options.  \nOptions:  \nA) Ana finished second-to-last. → False, she finished last.  \nB) Amy finished second-to-last. → False, she finished 2nd.  \nC) Dan finished second-to-last. → False, he finished 1st.  \nD) Mya finished second-to-last. → True, given.  \nE) Eve finished second-to-last. → False, she finished 3rd.  \n\nThe correct option is: D\nAnswer:\nD\n\n"}

L is the third-cheapest (so 3rd in ascending price).  \n7. P is the cheapest (1st in ascending).  \n\nStep 1 – Assign known positions from cheapest to most expensive (1 to 7):  \nP = 1 (cheapest)  \nL = 3 (third-cheapest)  \nW = 6 (second-most expensive)  \n\nSo positions:  \n1: P  \n3: L  \n6: W  \n\nStep 2 – Use ordering constraints:  \nFrom (5) A > L ⇒ A is in a position > 3.  \nFrom (2) A < C ⇒ C > A ⇒ C is above A.  \nFrom (1) W > C and W is at 6 ⇒ C must be less expensive than W, so C is in position < 6.  \n\nAlso from (4) L < K ⇒ K > L ⇒ K is above position 3.  \n\nStep 3 – Fill possible positions for A and C:  \nA > L (pos 3) and A < C and C < W (pos 6).  \nSo C could be pos 5 or pos 4 (since C < W=6 and C > A).  \nIf C = 5 ⇒ A < 5 ⇒ A could be 4.  \nIf C = 4 ⇒ A < 4 ⇒ A could be … but A > L=3 ⇒ A=4 not possible because C=4 and A<C ⇒ A<4 ⇒ A=2 or 3, but A>L=3 ⇒ A>3 ⇒ impossible.

The loquats are the second-cheapest.\nQuestion:\nWhich of the following is true?\nOptions:\nA) The oranges are the most expensive.\nB) The cantaloupes are the most expensive.\nC) The peaches are the most expensive.\nD) The loquats are the most expensive.\nE) The kiwis are the most expensive.\nReasoning:\nLet’s reason step by step.  \n\nWe have 5 fruits in order of price (most expensive → cheapest):  \n\n1. \"Peaches are more expensive than oranges\" → P > O.  \n2. \"Cantaloupes are more expensive than peaches\" → C > P > O.  \n3. \"Kiwis are the third-most expensive\" → Kiwis are in position 3 (middle of 5).  \n4. \"Loquats are the second-cheapest\" → Loquats are in position 4 (since cheapest is position 5).  \n\nPositions: 1 (most expensive), 2, 3, 4, 5 (cheapest).  \n\nFrom (4): Loquats = position 4.  \nFrom (3): Kiwis = position 3.  \n\nFrom (2): C > P > O.  \nSo C must be in a higher-numbered position (meaning smaller number = more expensive) than P, and P higher than O.  \n\nTry placing:  \n• C must be 1 or 2 (since C is more expensive than P, and P is more expensive than O).  \n\n• But if C were 2, then P would have to be 3, 4, or 5, but P > O, so O would be even lower. But position 3 is Kiwis, so P cannot be 3 (Kiwis fixed).  \n\nCheck possibility: C = 1, P = 2, O = 5? No, because O could be 4 or 5, but position 4 is Loquats, so O could be 5. Let’s test:  \n\nPositions:  \n1: C  \n2: P  \n3: K  \n4: L  \n5: O  \n\nCheck constraints:  \nC > P (yes, 1>2)  \nP > O (yes, 2>5)  \nKiwis 3 (yes)  \nLoquats 4 (yes)  \n\nAll consistent.  \n\nThus most expensive = Cantaloupes.  \n\nThe correct option is: B\nAnswer:\nB\n\n"}
