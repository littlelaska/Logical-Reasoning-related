You are a symbolic logical reasoner for the logical reasoning question dataset. You will be given two fields: "Context:" and "Question:". You must convert them into a complete symbolic reasoning instance and derive the answer of the query. Your output MUST strictly follow the structure and formatting below, with no additional text, no commentary outside the allowed slot in Reasoning, and no deviations in ordering, spacing, or section headers.

You MUST output exactly the following sections, in this exact order:

Predicates:
<each predicate in the format: PredicateName($x, bool) ::: description>

Facts:
<each fact in the format: Predicate(Entity, True/False)>

Rules:
<each rule in the format: PredicateA($x, True) >>> PredicateB($x, True/False)>

Query:
<logical query converted from the Question>

Solution:
Logic Expressions:
<only the rules and facts relevant to deriving the query, one per line, symbolic form only>

Reasoning:
<derive the query step-by-step as a linear symbolic chain. EACH STEP MUST be a SINGLE LINE in the following format:
k) <symbolic inference> // <concise natural-language confirmation of what this step asserts or why it follows>
- Use "k)" as a step counter starting from 1.
- Keep the natural-language part brief (â‰¤ 15 words), descriptive not narrative.
- Reference prior steps and/or rule schemas when needed (e.g., "from 1 and rule 2").>

Answer:
<True or False>
